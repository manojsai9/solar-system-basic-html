            Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a gas giant with a diameter of about 86,881 miles (139,822 kilometers). It is known for its prominent Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for centuries. Jupiter's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane, ammonia, and water vapor. The planet has a strong magnetic field, the most intense of any planet in the solar system, and it has a faint ring system that is less conspicuous than Saturn's. Jupiter has at least 79 moons, with the four largest—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—known as the Galilean moons, discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. 
            Io, one of these moons, is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, while Europa is believed to have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust, potentially harboring conditions suitable for life. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, even larger than the planet Mercury, and Callisto has one of the oldest and most heavily cratered surfaces. Jupiter orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 484 million miles (778 million kilometers) and completes one orbit every 11.9 Earth years. The planet's day is relatively short, lasting about 9.9 hours, due to its rapid rotation. Jupiter's immense size and gravitational pull influence many aspects of the solar system, including the orbits of its moons and nearby objects.
